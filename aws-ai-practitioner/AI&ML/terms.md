# ML Terms that may be on the exam

GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) : generate human text or computer code based on input prompts.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) : similar to GPT, but reads the text in two directions.

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) : meant for sequential data such as time-series or text, useful in speech recognition, time-series prediction.

ResNet (Residual Network) : Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image recognition tasks, object detection, facial recognition.

SVM (Support Vector Machine) : ML algorithm for classification and regression.

WaveNet : model to generate raw audio waveform, used in Speech Synthesis.

GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) : models used to generate synthetic data such as images, videos or sounds that resemble the training data. Helpful for data augmentation.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) : an implementation of gradient boosting.
