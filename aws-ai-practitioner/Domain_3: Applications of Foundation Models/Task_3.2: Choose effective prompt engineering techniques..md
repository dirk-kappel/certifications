## Describe the concepts and constructs of prompt engineering (for example, context, instruction, negative prompts, model latent space).
## Understand techniques for prompt engineering (for example, chain-of-thought, zero-shot, single-shot, few-shot, prompt templates).
## Understand the benefits and best practices for prompt engineering (for example, response quality improvement, experimentation, guardrails, discovery, specificity and concision, using multiple comments).
## Define potential risks and limitations of prompt engineering (for example, exposure, poisoning, hijacking, jailbreaking).
