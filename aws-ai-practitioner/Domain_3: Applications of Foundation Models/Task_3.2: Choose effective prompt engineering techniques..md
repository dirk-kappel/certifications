## Describe the concepts and constructs of prompt engineering (for example, context, instruction, negative prompts, model latent space).
**Context**: Providing background information or framing the task to guide the model in generating relevant responses.

**Instruction**: Explicitly stating the desired action or output format to ensure clarity.

**Negative Prompts**: Specifying what the model should avoid, improving response quality by reducing irrelevant or undesirable outputs.

**Model Latent Space**: The internal representation of knowledge within the model that determines its response patterns based on the prompt.

## Understand techniques for prompt engineering (for example, chain-of-thought, zero-shot, single-shot, few-shot, prompt templates).
**Chain-of-Thought**: Encouraging the model to generate intermediate steps or reasoning before providing a final answer, improving accuracy on complex tasks.

**Zero-Shot**: Asking the model to perform a task without providing examples, relying on its general understanding.

**Single-Shot**: Providing one example in the prompt to guide the model’s behavior.

**Few-Shot**: Including multiple examples in the prompt to improve performance on nuanced or domain-specific tasks.

**Prompt Templates**: Predefined structures for prompts that can be reused across tasks for consistency and efficiency.

## Understand the benefits and best practices for prompt engineering (for example, response quality improvement, experimentation, guardrails, discovery, specificity and concision, using multiple comments).
**Benefits**:
- Response Quality Improvement: Ensures precise and relevant outputs.
- Experimentation: Facilitates testing of different phrasing and strategies to optimize responses.
- Guardrails: Helps control outputs to align with ethical and safety standards.
- Discovery: Enables exploration of the model's capabilities and limitations.
- Specificity and Concision: Improves clarity and focus by eliminating ambiguity.
- Using Multiple Comments: In complex tasks, layering prompts or interacting iteratively refines responses.

**Best Practices**:
- Start with clear, concise instructions.
- Use examples to guide the model when needed.
- Test and refine prompts iteratively.
- Avoid overly broad or ambiguous phrasing.
- Leverage context and negative prompts to reduce irrelevant outputs.

## Define potential risks and limitations of prompt engineering (for example, exposure, poisoning, hijacking, jailbreaking).
**Exposure**: Prompts might inadvertently reveal sensitive information if not carefully constructed.

**Poisoning**: Malicious inputs could alter the model’s behavior or output harmful content.

**Hijacking**: Unauthorized users could exploit prompts to manipulate model responses.

**Jailbreaking**: Crafting prompts to bypass ethical, safety, or policy constraints, leading to inappropriate or harmful outputs.
