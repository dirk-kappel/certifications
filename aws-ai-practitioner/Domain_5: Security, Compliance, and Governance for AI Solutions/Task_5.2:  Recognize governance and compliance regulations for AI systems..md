## Identify regulatory compliance standards for AI systems (for example, International Organization for Standardization [ISO], System and Organization Controls [SOC], algorithm accountability laws).
**ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**:
- ISO provides a series of standards related to data protection, privacy, and AI ethics, such as ISO/IEC 27001 (information security management) and ISO/IEC 23894 (AI governance).

**SOC (System and Organization Controls)**:
- SOC 2 and SOC 3 reports focus on data security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, which are critical for ensuring compliance in AI systems handling sensitive data.

**Algorithm Accountability Laws**:
- Various regions (e.g., the EU with its AI Act, or California with the CCPA) are creating regulations for algorithm transparency, accountability, and fairness. These laws demand that AI systems be auditable and that organizations can explain how decisions are made by their models.

## Identify AWS services and features to assist with governance and regulation compliance (for example, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, AWS Audit Manager, AWS Artifact, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Trusted Advisor).
**AWS Config**:
- AWS Config enables compliance auditing and monitoring by recording the configuration of AWS resources and providing detailed historical configuration information to track changes and maintain compliance.

**Amazon Inspector**:
- A security assessment service that helps evaluate the security and compliance of applications, including AI models, by scanning for vulnerabilities.

**AWS Audit Manager**:
- Automates the process of collecting evidence for audits and helps ensure that AI systems meet industry standards for compliance.

**AWS Artifact**:
- A resource that provides on-demand access to AWS compliance reports, certifications, and agreements to help businesses meet regulatory requirements.

**AWS CloudTrail**:
- CloudTrail logs AWS account activity, including actions on AI-related resources, enabling traceability and audits to ensure compliance with regulations.

**AWS Trusted Advisor**:
- Provides insights into AWS environment configurations, including security and compliance checks, which can assist in aligning AI system architecture with best practices.

## Describe data governance strategies (for example, data lifecycles, logging, residency, monitoring, observation, retention).
**Data Lifecycles**:
- Define clear stages for data from creation, storage, processing, and analysis, to deletion or archiving, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and ethical guidelines.

**Logging**:
- Implement detailed logging to track data access, modifications, and processing events. This helps ensure accountability and traceability, especially in AI systems.

**Residency**:
- Ensure that data is stored in regions that comply with local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU) and keep track of data residency to prevent legal risks.

**Monitoring and Observation**:
- Continuously monitor AI models and datasets to ensure ongoing compliance and that the systems are operating within defined ethical boundaries and performance standards.

**Retention**:
- Establish policies for how long data should be kept and when it should be archived or deleted, based on regulatory requirements and business needs.

## Describe processes to follow governance protocols (for example, policies, review cadence, review strategies, governance frameworks such as the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix, transparency standards, team training requirements).
**Policies**:
- Create and enforce comprehensive data governance policies that address privacy, security, data access, and model accountability, ensuring that AI systems comply with regulatory and organizational standards.

**Review Cadence**:
- Implement regular review cycles to assess compliance with governance policies, AI system performance, and regulatory requirements. This might include quarterly or annual audits.

**Review Strategies**:
- Develop strategies for reviewing both the AI models and the data used to train them, ensuring that updates or changes are aligned with governance protocols and compliance standards.

**Governance Frameworks (e.g., Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix)**:
- Utilize frameworks that provide a structured approach for assessing and managing risks associated with generative AI, including security, privacy, and fairness.

**Transparency Standards**:
- Set standards for transparency in AI system design and decision-making processes, ensuring that AI models are auditable, and that stakeholders understand how outcomes are derived.

**Team Training Requirements**:
- Regularly train AI development and operational teams on governance protocols, ethical considerations, and compliance requirements to ensure consistent adherence to standards across the organization.
