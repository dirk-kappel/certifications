## Understand foundational generative AI concepts (for example, tokens, chunking, embeddings, vectors, prompt engineering, transformer-based LLMs, foundation models, multi-modal models, diffusion models).
**Tokens**: Tokens are the basic units of text that the model processes. Tokens can be words, phrases, or individual characters like a period. Tokens also provide standardization of input data, which makes it easier for the model to process.

**Embeddings**: Numerical representations of tokens, where each token is assigned a vector (a list of numbers) that captures its meaning and relationships with other tokens. These vectors are learned during the training process and allow the model to understand the context and nuances of language.

**Vectors**: Mathematical arrays that represent data points in a multi-dimensional space, often used in embeddings to measure similarity.

**Diffussion Models**: A deep learning architecture system that starts with pure noise or random data. The models gradually add more and more meaningful information to this noise until they end up with a clear and coherent output, like an image or a piece of text. Diffusion models learn through a two-step process of forward diffusion and reverse diffusion.

**Multimodal Models**: Multimodal models can process and generate multiple modes of data simultaneously. For example, a multimodal model could take in an image and some text as input, and then generate a new image and a caption describing it as output.
- These kinds of models learn how different modalities like images and text are connected and can influence each other. Multimodal models can be used for automating video captioning, creating graphics from text instructions, answering questions more intelligently by combining text and visual info, and even translating content while keeping relevant visuals.

**Chunking**: Splitting data into smaller segments or chunks to manage memory usage and process long inputs efficiently.

**Prompt Engineering**: Prompts act as instructions for foundation models. Prompt engineering focuses on developing, designing, and optimizing prompts to enhance the output of FMs for your needs. It gives you a way to guide the model's behavior to the outcomes that you want to achieve.
- Instructions: This is a task for the FM to do. It provides a task description or instruction for how the model should perform.
- Context: This is external information to guide the model.
- Input Data: This is the input for which you want a response.
- Output Indicator: This is the output type or format.

**Transformer-Based LLMs**: Large language models that use transformer architectures, such as GPT or BERT, to process sequential data efficiently and understand context.

**Foundation Models**: Large, pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as OpenAI’s GPT or Google’s BERT.

## Identify potential use cases for generative AI models (for example, image, video, and audio generation; summarization; chatbots; translation; code generation; customer service agents; search; recommendation engines).
**Image Generation**: Creating original artwork, graphics, or design concepts, as well as enhancing or modifying existing images.

**Video Generation**: Producing synthetic videos for entertainment, education, or marketing, including automated video editing and animation.

**Audio Generation**: Generating music, voiceovers, or sound effects, including synthetic speech for virtual assistants.

**Summarization**: Condensing long documents, articles, or reports into concise summaries for easier comprehension.

**Chatbots**: Enabling conversational AI for customer support, personal assistants, or interactive learning.

**Translation**: Providing accurate and context-aware translations between languages.

**Code Generation**: Assisting developers by generating code snippets, automating repetitive coding tasks, or providing debugging suggestions.

**Customer Service Agents**: Automating responses to customer queries, improving response time and personalization.

**Search**: Enhancing search engines with AI-powered relevance and contextual understanding to deliver more precise results.

**Recommendation Engines**: Generating personalized recommendations for products, content, or services based on user behavior and preferences.

## Describe the foundation model lifecycle (for example, data selection, model selection, pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, feedback).
**Data Selection**: Choosing and collecting diverse, high-quality data that is representative of the tasks the model will perform. This includes cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure consistency.

**Model Selection**: Deciding on the architecture and size of the model, such as transformer-based models like GPT or BERT, depending on the application and data availability.

**Pre-Training**: Training the model on large-scale, general-purpose datasets to learn broad patterns and representations. This process provides a strong foundation for fine-tuning.

**Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning is a supervised learning process that involves taking a pre-trained model and adding specific, smaller datasets. Adding these narrower datasets modifies the weights of the data to better align with the task.
- Instruction fine-tuning uses examples of how the model should respond to a specific instruction. Prompt tuning is a type of instruction fine-tuning.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) provides human feedback data, resulting in a model that is better aligned with human preferences.

**Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score on test datasets. This step identifies areas for improvement.

**Deployment**: Integrating the model into production systems for real-world use, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.

**Feedback**: Continuously monitoring the model's performance in the deployed environment, collecting user feedback, and retraining or updating the model to address issues or improve accuracy.
