## Describe components of an ML pipeline (for example, data collection, exploratory data analysis [EDA], data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment, monitoring).
## Understand sources of ML models (for example, open source pre-trained models, training custom models).
## Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API service, self-hosted API).
## Identify relevant AWS services and features for each stage of an ML pipeline (for example, SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor).
## Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example, experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing technical debt, achieving production readiness, model monitoring, model re-training).
## Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per user, development costs, customer feedback, return on investment [ROI]) to evaluate ML models.
